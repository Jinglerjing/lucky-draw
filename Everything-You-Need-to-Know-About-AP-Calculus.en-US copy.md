Which AP Calculus should you take? Let's look at both courses in detail, starting with AP Calculus AB.

## AP Calculus AB Course Overview

AP Calculus AB covers topics equivalent to a first-semester college calculus course**,** focusing on foundational calculus concepts like limits, derivatives, and basic integrals. You'll also gain skills in critical thinking, problem analyzing and solving.

Here's a quick overview of the AP Calculus AB course content: 

- **Limits** describe the behavior of a function as its input (often called *x*) gets closer and closer to a specific value. Imagine a simple function like f(x) = x + 1. 

The function is f(x) = x + 1, meaning whatever value you plug in for x, you just add 1. So we say that as x gets closer to 2, the f(x) value gets closer to 3. 

How it's solved: f(x) = 2 + 1 = 3

Limits are essential for solving problems in physics, engineering, and other fields because they help to analyze points where a function isn’t defined or has gaps.

- **Derivatives** are used to measure the **rate of change** of a function at a specific point. Applications include **velocity** (the rate of change of position over time), **acceleration** (the rate of change of velocity over time), and **optimization** (the maximum or minimum values of a function). 

Imagine a farmer with 100 meters of fencing to build a rectangular fence. What dimensions maximize the area? 

Here's how you can solve it: 

- Let **l** be the length, and **w** the width. The perimeter **P** = 2l + 2w = 100, so y = 50 − x.
- The area is P = l⋅w = l(50−l) = 50l − l^2.
- Differentiate: P′(l) = 50 − 2l.
- Set P′(l)= 0:50 − 2l = 0  ⟹  l = 25.
- Dimensions: l = 25 (length), w = 25 (width) 

The dimensions that maximize the area are 25 meters by 25 meters, and the maximum area is: P = 25 x 25 = 625 square meters.

- **Integrals** are used to find the area under a curve. Here's an example of what you will learn in an AP Calculus AB course, asking you to find the area under the curve f(x) = 2x + 3 from x = 0 to x = 4.

Integrals can solve problems in Physics, Geometry, accumulation of quantities, growth/decay (take population growth as an example), and optimization. 

- **Applications of Derivatives and Integrals** in AP Calculus AB are not just theoretical, they’re powerful tools for solving real-world problems in physics, engineering, economics, biology, and other fields. 

For example, in physics, you can use derivatives to measure the rate of change. In business and economics, you need integrals and derivatives to analyze cost, profit, and revenue functions.

## AP Calculus BC Course Overview

AP Calculus BC covers all the topics taught in Calculus AB, plus more advanced topics such as <a href="https://www.mathos.ai/blog/guide-parametric-equations-what-they-are-how-to-use" target="_blank">parametric equations</a>, polar coordinates, vector-valued functions, and infinite sequences and series. Here's a quick overview of the additional topics: 

- **Parametric equations** express the coordinates of a point in terms of a third variable, typically denoted as *t*. Instead of directly relating *x* and *y*, parametric equations define x and y as functions of *t.*

A simple example of parametric equations is the representation of a circle: x = r cos(t), y = r sin(t) where r is the radius of the circle and t is the parameter ranging from 0 to 2π. 

- **Polar coordinates** are a two-dimensional coordinate system where each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a fixed point and an angle from a fixed direction. A point in polar coordinates is written as (r, θ).

An example of a polar function is the cardioid: r = 1 + cos⁡(θ).

- **Vector-valued functions** are mathematical functions that take one or more variables as input and return a vector as output. These functions are useful in describing motion in space, curves, and physical phenomena. 

For example, a vector-valued helix function: r(t)= (cos⁡(t), sin⁡(t), t) creates a spiral path by circling around (cos(t), sin(t)) and rising vertically (t). As *t* increases, the path winds up and rises. 

<figure> <img src="https://fmd-mathgpt-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/blog-image/2025_02_03-a178f9bef72a07257086527b2face1b5.png" alt="3D parametric graph"/> <figcaption style="text-align: center;">3D parametric graph of r(t)=⟨cos⁡(t),sin⁡(t),t⟩</figcaption> </figure>

- An **infinite sequence** is an ordered list of numbers that goes on forever. Each number in the sequence is called a *term*, and the position of a term in the sequence is often denoted by *n*, where n=1,2,3,…, so an infinite sequence is represented as: a1,a2,a3,… An **infinite series** is the sum of the terms of an infinite sequence. You can write it as a1 + a2 + a3 + … 

See this example of the sum of an infinite series: 

<figure> <img src="https://fmd-mathgpt-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/public/blog-image/2025_02_03-1cc938bdd90e8bf195713c0cc2fc348e.png" alt="sum of an infinite series"/> <figcaption style="text-align: center;">example of the sum of an infinite series</figcaption> </figure>

## Which AP Course Should You Take?

So should you take AP Calculus AB or BC? First of all, there are prerequisites before you can take AP Calculus. You must complete Algebra 2 and Precalculus. If you've taken both, consider the three factors below before deciding which AP course to take. 

1. **Your current math level**

If you have a strong foundation in trigonometry and algebra, you might be well-prepared for the challenge of fast-paced Calculus BC, which requires analytical thinking and covers more advanced math topics such as parametric equations, polar coordinates, and series. 

However, if you don't have a solid foundation in limits, derivatives, integrals, and their basic applications, Calculus AB or Precalculus could be a better option to begin with. 

1. **Your college plans**

If you’re aiming for a STEM-related field like engineering, physics, computer science, or even economics, taking AP Calculus BC can be a great advantage. For example, in engineering, you’ll need to understand things like power series for circuit analysis, and in physics, parametric equations are essential for modeling motion. Plus, it grants more college credits than Calculus AB. 

AP Calculus AB works for both STEM and non-STEM majors. For instance, a business major might only need calculus to understand optimization problems or calculate growth rates, which are covered in Calculus AB.

Can't decide on a major yet? If your goal is to earn college credit and save money on college tuition, check the <a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/getting-credit-placement/search-policies" target="_blank">AP Credit Policy</a> of the college you're applying to.

1. **Workload and time commitment**

If you’re already balancing a busy schedule with other challenging coursework, Calculus AB might be the better option to keep things manageable. Calculus BC is considered one of the hardest AP courses, not necessarily because of the curriculum, it's more about its heavy workload. The course is fast-paced and covers more in-depth topics that require extra time to study. 

## Effective Ways to Study For AP Calculus Exams

- **Master the core concept and formula**

Focus on understanding the core concepts like limits, derivatives, and integrals (If you're taking Calculus BC, you should master series and parametric equations as well).  Memorize essential formulas for differentiation, integration, and geometry. The best way to understand and memorize the formulas is to apply them in practice. 

For example, practice applying the product rule for derivatives:  f(x) = x²sin(x), use the formula f′(x) = u′v + uv′ to find f'(x) = 2xsin(x) + x²cos(x).

- **Take advantage of high-quality learning resources**

Besides the course materials, you can find plenty of helpful online resources like College Board's <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/instructional-resources/ap-classroom" target="_blank">AP Classroom</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/get-ready-for-ap-calc" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@advancedplacement" target="_blank">YouTube channels</a>, etc to find practice questions and explained solutions.  

If you run into any problem while doing homework, ask for help immediately, and don't accumulate problems. It'd be good to have tutor sections to solve specific problems. If you can't find a tutor, try an <a href="https://www.mathos.ai/app/tutor" target="_blank">AI math tutor</a> or <a href="https://www.mathos.ai/blog/desmos-mathos-ai-which-math-solver-good-college-homework" target="_blank">homework helper</a> to get instant help. 

https://youtu.be/4twGM1J0Slw?si=15Lm6yqs9TaMj5mm

- **Learn from practice exams**

Understanding concepts and formulas is important, but knowing how to apply them in practice is even more important. As you do more practice tests or exams, you find out your weaknesses, which helps you target the weaknesses because you can focus on the wrong answers and analyze why you get them wrong. 

It's highly recommended that you do practice exams consistently because consistent practice over time is more effective than cramming the night before.  It's also a good idea to take practice exams under timed conditions to familiarize yourself with the actual exam. 

Another tip is to practice how to use a graphing calculator effectively for the calculator-allowed sections of the exam. 

## Conclusion

AP Calculus AB and BC are college-level calculus courses. Calculus AB covers fundamental concepts like limits, derivatives, and integrals, providing a solid foundation in calculus. Calculus BC delves deeper into the concepts taught in Calculus AB and introduces additional topics such as parametric equations, polar coordinates, and sequences and series.

Choosing between AP Calculus AB and BC depends on your academic goals and comfort level with challenging coursework. If you're unsure about the rigor of calculus or plan to pursue a non-STEM field, Calculus AB may be a better fit. However, if you excel in math, are interested in STEM fields, and are prepared for a fast-paced and demanding course, Calculus BC can provide a significant advantage by potentially earning you more college credit and a head start in your studies.
